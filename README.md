# Challenge

I did the challenge, however, I didn't get the second challenge in JAVA, however, I have ideas on how to do it in other programming languages.

The first challenge was completed, but when listing the users who are most in the movies, I couldn't filter, so it's returning all users from the movies, the rest is normal.

To start, just open Test.java(You need some IDE(Eclipse) to run the class.)


The third challenge has been completed.
